# Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction  
Prediction of engine degradation using NASA CMAPSS dataset with XGBoost & LSTM.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan engines using:
- Time series windows
- Feature engineering
- Hybrid models (XGBoost + LSTM)

It follows a production-ready structure with preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a clear configuration system (`config.yaml`).
